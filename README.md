Apollonian circle packing methods

Library methods are stored in libapol-VERSION.so.
If your version of PARI/GP is not one of the listed versions, you should check that your PARI/GP installation is in the location specified by the first line of the makefile, and modify it to the correct location if not. Afterwards, call "make all" to make the library file. Non 2-16 versions are not kept up to date as much, so it is suggested to do this anyways unless you are running the development version.

Start the program with "gp apol".
